# ChemicalManufacturingProcess
#This Repository contains codes used by me to analyse ChemicalManufacturingProcess dataset present in AppliedPredictiveModeling library of R.
In this, CMP dataset was first preprocessed and checked for quality.
NA values were replaced by the mean values of that column and other undesirable columns were removed
The cleaned dataset was then used to train the ML models
Trained models were then tested with Test dataset obtained as a subset of CMP dataset

ML algorithms used includes- Linear Regression
                             Multiple Linear Regression
                             Polynomial Regression
                             Support Vector Regression
                             Decision Tree Regression
                             Random Forest Regression
                             
Performance of these models could be compared via various parameters.
